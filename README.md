# Crypto

This is very simple xor-cryptography tool. It encrypts your input file and gives you a key. Also it can decrypt your string with your key.

Flags:
  -i — input file
  -o — output file
  -cs — chunk size (size of block that would be encrypted/decrypted)
  -b — bias (bytes shift)
  -d — decrypt flag (key that was given after encryption)
